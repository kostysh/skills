# Edge Security (platform features)

- Enable managed WAF rules for baseline protection on public APIs.
- Use API Shield / endpoint discovery (or equivalent) to detect unknown endpoints and monitor exposure.
- Consider edge schema validation to reject malformed/abusive requests before they hit the worker.
- Use mTLS where supported for high-trust partner integrations.
