# Foundation: Ant Design System Framing

Use this file when the user asks **what Ant Design is**, **why it exists**, or needs system‑level framing before implementation guidance.

## What Ant Design is (system purpose)

**Context**: Ant Design is a design system for enterprise products with complex scenarios and frequent change.
**Goal**: Unify UI specifications, reduce redundancy and production cost, and improve user experience.
**Design values**: Natural, Certain, Meaningful, Growing.
**Docs**:
- `https://ant.design/docs/spec/introduce`
- `https://ant.design/docs/spec/values`

## What the design system provides

**Guidelines & resources**: design patterns, visualization, illustrations, and design resources.
**Front‑end implementation**: React is the official implementation; other frameworks exist but vary in parity.
**Docs**:
- `https://ant.design/docs/spec/introduce`
- `https://ant.design/docs/spec/overview`
- `https://ant.design/docs/react/getting-started`

## How to apply this framing in answers

- **If the user asks “which framework rules to follow?”** point to spec pages (layout/navigation/data entry/display).
- **If they ask “what is the source of truth?”**: design specs for behavior/visual rules, component docs for API.
- **If they ask about implementation parity**: React is the official source; other frameworks may diverge.
